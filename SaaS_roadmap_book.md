## Core Framework

### The Two Main Components

The book's pricing structure revolves around two main tools:

1. **Product Packaging** - How you bundle and present your offering
2. **Pricing Metrics** - The unit by which you charge customers

The fundamental principle: *"Price your customer, not your product"* - implying that you should set up a structure that allows you to differentiate between different customers based on their needs and willingness to pay.

### The Three Key Tools for Product Models

A well-structured product model is built using:

1. **Fencing** - The process of differentiating customers by their needs and willingness to pay
2. **Laddering** - Creating tiers that allow customers to grow with your product
3. **Pricing Metrics** - Units of measurement that align value delivered with price charged

## Key Concepts

### Pricing is Design, Not Math

Chapter 1 emphasizes that pricing is not just about numbers but about strategic design. Many entrepreneurs approach pricing as a math problem when, in reality, it is a decision-making process that shapes the success or failure of a product.

### The Product Model (Chapter 3)

This chapter explores the product model as a crucial element in designing an effective SaaS pricing strategy. It explains how businesses should:
- Package their offerings effectively
- Segment customers appropriately
- Create a pricing structure that maximizes revenue while ensuring long-term growth

### Metric Density Framework

The book presents a Metric Density pattern for evaluating pricing effectiveness:

| Density Range | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| 0 - 0.25 | Poor monetization with critical issues in sales process and product adoption |
| 0.25 - 0.50 | Subpar monetization with heavy discounting and extended sales cycles |
| 0.50 - 0.75 | Strong monetization with only minor issues |
| 0.75 - 1.0 | Excellent monetization |
